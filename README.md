fix2json
=====

## About 

fix2json is a command-line utility to present FIX(TV) protocol message files as JSON.

Some scenarios where fix2json might be of use are:

* Within the ingestion pipeline of trading venue drop copy files into ElasticSearch
* Performing command-line ETL or manipulation of FIX data, often in concert with other CLI utilities such as jq or XMLStarlet
* As a pre-processor for inserting FIX records into JSON-conformant NoSQL repositories, such as Google BigQuery or MongoDB. 

The current level of fix2json semantic naivete is very high.  As such, users should consider ensuring the semantic validity of all FIX messages upstream.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g fix2json
```

## Examples
```bash
$ ./fix2json.js
Usage: fix2json <data dictionary xml file> <FIX message file>

$ du -hs MDFF_CME_20130714-20130715_7818_0
2.2G      MDFF_CME_20130714-20130715_7818_0

$ ./fix2json.js dict/FIX50SP2.xml MDFF_CME_20130714-20130715_7818_0

## Caveats

* fix2json makes no semantic judgements about the FIX data being processed and blindly applies the specified data dictionary to the input FIX file.  Feedback from the community on an appropriate level of validation is welcomed.

* fix2json now uses streams instead of loading up the entire source file in one go.  This means that you can process a 2G+ file starting immediately.  What this also means is that fix2json no longer returns a proper JSON array as it's output.  Individual JSON objects will be output that correspond to the individual messages in the source file.  For this reason, pretty printing has been disabled as well.  This can be added as a CLI option at some point.

* fix2json will replace underscores ('_') with spaces (' ') for all mnemonic tag descriptions found in the input data dictionary.  Hence, a description for EventType will be in the data dictionary as "LAST_ELIGIBLE_TRADE_DATE", but will be interpreted by fix2json as "LAST ELIGIBLE TRADE DATE"
